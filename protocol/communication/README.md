Communication

A guide for communicating within Healthify.

Pivotal Tracker Stories
-------

* Software Engineers are grouped into squads that work toward goals within product themes over the course of a multi-week cycle.
* Squad leads organize ad hoc check-ins and planning meetings to scope out new user stories and set context for which people are most apt to work on them.
* Update others on your progress by adding comments to the Tracker story you are working on.
* Ask clarifying questions about a user story within the context of that story on tracker.


Standups and EOD Updates
-------

### Standups
* At the begining of the day, each squad member posts in their respective standup thread in the #dev Slack channel.
* Write out the things you plan to work on that day.
* It's a good idea to include any meetings you plan to attend

### End of Day
* At the end of the day, each squad member posts in their respective EOD thread
* Simply post what you got done during the day
