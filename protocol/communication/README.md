Pivotal Tracker Stories
-------

* Software Engineers join the bi-weekly IPM to discuss the user stories (and chores, and bugs) for the week.
* People assign themselves to Tracker stories. When in doubt, do not assign a ticket to someone else.
* Update others on your progress by adding comments to the Tracker story you are working on.
* Ask clarifying questions about a user story within the context of that story on tracker.
